# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
#
# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]
#
# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.
#
# e.g.
#
# 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146
#
# There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights
#
# 1146 รท 7 = 163.71428571428572
#
# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164
#
# Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.
#
# Example Input 1
# 156 178 165 171 187
# In this case, student_heights would be a list that looks like: [156, 178, 165, 171, 187]
#
# Example Output 1
# total height = 857
# number of students = 5
# average height = 171
# Example Input 2
# 151 145 179
# Example Output 2
# total height = 475
# number of students = 3
# average height = 158
